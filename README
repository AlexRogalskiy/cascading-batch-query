Compiling:

You need to have HADOOP_HOME set to the root directory of Hadoop on your computer.
CASACADING_HOME must point to a directory containing the cascading jar and cascading jar dependencies.

This source code is adapted from Rapleaf's production code. Rapleaf's version uses particular datastores and that dependency has been removed for 
this release.


Testing batch queries:

Distributed cache does not work in local mode in Hadoop. For this reason, the Relevance class has an alternate code path for the purposes of writing
unit tests that utilize batch queries. In order to activate "test mode", add this code to your test:

Relevance.TEST_MODE = true;
